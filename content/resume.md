## Technical Projects
**High-Performance Image Processing Application on Manycore Architecture**
- Implemented Gaussian Blur algorithm for host and device code on Hammerblade Manycore Architecture (128 cores with L1/L2 cache and sharable DRAM, 2D mesh/ruche and wormhole NoC);
- Optimized the algorithm using Memory Level Parallelism and cache locality, achieving 69.4% total core utilization in Verilator simulation with 10x speedup.
- **see Report here**: [High-Performance Image Processing Application Implementation and Optimization on HammerBlade Manycore Architecture](GaussianBlur_HBimplement.pdf)

**Machine Learning and Neural Network for MNIST and FashionMNIST Dataset**
- Trained Classifiers to distinguish MNIST dataset using PCA, Ridge Classifier, LDA, KNN, linear and non-linear SVM with cross validation, and achieved test accuracy of 98.33% 
    - **see Report here**: [Use Multiple Classifier to Distinguish Handwritten Digits from MNIST Dataset](Classifier_MNIST.pdf)
- Designed Fully Connected Deep Neural Networks (FCN) ([**see Report here**](DNN_FashionMNIST.pdf)) and Convolutional Deep Neural Networks (CNN) ([**see Report here**](CNN_cuda.pdf)) with different optimizers (SGD, RMSprop, Adam), Regularization (dropout), Initialization (Gaussian, Xavier Normal, Kaiming Uniform) and Batch Normalization methods; Fine tuning the hyperparameters and achieved 91.2% test accuracy on FashionMNIST and 98.32% on MNIST.

**Signal Processing for Locating Submarine Using Fourier Transform**
- Identified the frequency signature and the trajectory of the submarine under water using 3D Fourier Transform coupled with a carefully designed Gaussian filter.
- **see Report here**: [Locate Submarine with Acoustic Data Using Signal Filtering and Fourier Transform](Submarine_SignalFFT.pdf)

**Dimensional Reduction Based Motion Recognition**
- Successfully used SVD / PCA in reducing dimension of humanoid robot movements (walking, jumping, running) with accuracy rate of 95.33%.
- **see Report here**: [Unsupervised Learning Using Dimensional Reduction in Movement Recognition](DimReduction_MovementRecog.pdf)
